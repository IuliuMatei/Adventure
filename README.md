# Adventure

This little game is about an adventure.

The game begins when you are in your home and you have some decisions to make. You can see your items, you can buy new items and go to adventures. 
Going to adventures is the only way you can earn money and boost your level, but you can also lose the game if you have very little hp.

This project uses every OOP principle Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction and Polymorphism. Also, it is divided in files to make it more reader friendly.

I remind you that this project was not made for wrong inputs, so be careful when you check it.
